## CALLING API FUNCTIONS FROM THE FRONT-END

- Clicking the "Save" button from the category pop up window with no data entered messes with the xml files on the back end. We dont want to call back-end functions unless that data that has been entered is legit.
- If a non-numeric entry is entered for "Monthly Allotment" in the category pop up window, the program will crash trying to convert it to a float. We need to use a try/except block to fix this.

## FRONT-END


## BACK-END
- parser has random quotation marks when it collects the info on transactions, its from the quotations
when it pulled it from the csv. See the unhandledTransactions List Widget. Just need cleaner extraction of the good stuff 

- unhandled transactions are made their own category when the app starts up. However, we dont want the GUI to make a category tab for unhandled transactions because they are printed in a seperate window. I have all of the tabs being automatically updated based on the categories that currently exist. We need unhandled to somehow not be counted in this

- every time a new transaction is dragged and dropped to the new category, all of the existing keywords are repeated and duplicated onto the idKeywords again

-if we delete a category, the transactions are gone forever. We will need to take those completed transactions and put them back in the unhandled category when we delete a user-made category
