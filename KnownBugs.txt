## CALLING API FUNCTIONS FROM THE FRONT-END

- Clicking the "Save" button from the category pop up window with no data entered messes with the xml files on the back end. We dont want to call back-end functions unless that data that has been entered is legit.
- If a non-numeric entry is entered for "Monthly Allotment" in the category pop up window, the program will crash trying to convert it to a float. We need to use a try/except block to fix this.

## FRONT-END


## BACK-END
- parser has random quotation marks when it collects the info on transactions, its from the quotations
when it pulled it from the csv. See the unhandledTransactions List Widget. Just need cleaner extraction of the good stuff
